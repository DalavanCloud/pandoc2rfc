# Tests

This appendix consists out of a few tests that should all render to proper
`xml2rfc` XML.

## A Very Long Title Considerations With Regards to the Already Deployed Routing Policy

Test a very long title.

## RFC 2119

**MUST** becomes tagged, MUST does not.


## *Markup* in heading

This works now in `xml2rfc`.

## Unnumered section {-}

An unnumbered section. Should work.

## Blockquote

> This is a blockquote, how does it look?

And a line:

-------

And

> This is another
> More blockquoting

> > Quote in Quote

A list in quotes

> 1. First item
> 1. Second item


## Line blocks

| this is a line block, empty line after this one
|
| Should be followed by a new line
|    starts with 3 spaces.
| And another line

In between text

| hel
| lo! and a [RFC2119](#RFC2119) reference.

Another item to explain:

     Multiple paragraphs in such a list.

### Lists in Description Lists

Item to explain:

    1. One
    2. Two

Another item to explain:
:   More explaining

Item to explain:
:   It works because of

    1. One1
    2. Two1
        
        * Itemize list
        * Another item

Another item to explain again:
:   More explaining

### List with Description Lists

1. More

    Item to explain:
    :   Explanation ...

    Item to explain:
    :   Another explanation ...

2. Go'bye

Multiple paragraphs in a list.

1. This is the first bullet point and it needs multiple paragraphs...

    ... to be explained properly.

1. This is the next bullet. New paragraphs should be indented with 4 four spaces.

1. Another item with some artwork, indented by 8 spaces.

        Artwork

1. Final item.

xml2rfc does not allow this, so the second paragraph is faked with a

Ordered lists.

1. First item
2. Second item

A lowercase roman list:

i. Item 1
ii. Item 2

An uppercase roman list.

I.  Item1
II.  Item2
II.  Item 3

And default list markers ^[ ^list^ default markers ].

Some surrounding text, to make it look better.

#. First item. Use lot of text to get a real paragraphs sense.
    First item. Use lot of text to get a real paragraphs sense.
    First item. Use lot of text to get a real paragraphs sense.

-------------------------------------------------------------
 Centered   Default           Right Left
  Header    Aligned         Aligned Aligned
----------- ------- --------------- -------------------------
   First    row                12.0 Example of a row that
                                    spans multiple lines.

  Second    row                 5.0 Here's another one. Note
                                    the blank line between
                                    rows.
-------------------------------------------------------------

^[ ~tab:multiline~ Here's the caption. It, too, may span multiple lines. This is a multiline table. This is `verbatim` text.]

+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
+===============+===============+====================+
| Bananas       | $1.34         | built-in wrapper   |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Oranges       | $2.10         | cures scurvy       |
+---------------+---------------+--------------------+

^[ ~tab:grid~ Sample grid table.]

Grid tables without a caption

+---------------+---------------+--------------------+
| Fruit         | Price         | Advantages         |
+===============+===============+====================+
| Bananas       | $1.34         | *built-in wrapper* |

+---------------+---------------+--------------------+

This table has no caption, and therefor no reference. But you can refer to 
some of the other tables, with for instance:

    See [](#tab:grid)

Which will become "See [](#tab:grid)".

## Numbered examples

This is another example:

(@good) Another bla bla..

as (@good) shows...

## Figure tests

    This is a figure
    This is a figure
    This is a figure
    This is a figure
^[This is the caption, with text in `typewriter`.]

And how a figure that is not centered, do to using `figure` and not `Figure`.

    This is a figure
    This is a figure
^[ ~noref~ A non centered figure, and some *markup*, and more `ls`.]
