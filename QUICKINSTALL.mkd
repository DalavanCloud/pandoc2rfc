QUICK INSTALL

For Linux/Ubuntu:

* apt-get install xsltproc pandoc
* read the pandoc manual
* tweak the makefile
* Edit `middle.mkd`, `back.mkd` and/or `template.xml`
* Make

And you're all set. For other Unix-like systems it should be alike. Note that
you don't even need `xsltproc` per se, just a XSLT transformer program.
