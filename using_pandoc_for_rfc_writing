# Pandoc for RFC

When writing [RFC 4641](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4641.txt) we directly wrote the
XML. Needless to say kinda tedious even thought the XML of `xml2rfc` is very "light".

Nowadays I'm a fan of the markdown syntax and especially the syntax as supported (created?)
by [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

So for my next RFC (if ever!) I decided I wanted to use pandoc. As `xml2rfc` uses XML
I thought the easiest way would be to create `docbook` XML and transform that using
XSLT.

The `front` and `back` matters are not supported. You can use this to generate
the `middle` part of an RFC.

What is supported?

* list style=symbols
* list style=numbers
* list style=letters
* list style=hanging
* figure/artwork
* blockquote - this isn't supported by `xml2rfc`, so this is converted to
    figure/artwork paragraph.
* refs: external (eref)
* refs: internal (xref)
* spanx style=verb, style=emph

# Pandoc constructs

What do you need to type in pandoc to get the correct output:

## list style=symbols

    A symbol list.

    * Item one;
    * Item two.

Converts to xml2rfc: `<list style="symbol">`

## list style=numbers
    
    A numbered list.

    1. Item one;
    2. Item two.

Converts to xml2rfc: `<list style="numbers">`

## list style=letters
    
    A numbered list.

    a. Item one;
    b. Item two.

Converts to xml2rfc: `<list style="letters">`

## list style=hanging
This is more like a description list, so we need to use:

    First item that needs clarification

    :   Explanation one

    Second item that needs clarification

    :   Explanation two


Converts to xml2rfc: `<list style="hanging">` and `<t hangText="First item...">`

## figure/artwork

Just indent the paragraph with 4 spaces.

Converts to xml2rfc: `<figure><artwork> ... </artwork></figure>`

## refs: external

Converts to xml2rfc: `<spanx style="verb">`

## refs: internal

Converts to xml2rfc: `<spanx style="verb">`

## spanx style=...
The verb style can be selected with back-tics:

    `text`

Converts to xml2rfc: `<spanx style="verb">`

And the emphasis style with asterisks

    *text*

Converts to xml2rfc: `<spanx style="emph">`
