# Upgrading

The XML2RFC v3 is much more sane (XML-wise) then the v2 standard. Things like
emphasised text in headers is allowed because the title *attribute* is now a
`<name>`-element.

There is one place where v2 Pandoc documents will not be v3 documents and that
is when referencing figures and table with a footnote.

In v2:

:    A figure/table is referenced with

        ^[anchor::caption]

In v3:

:   A figure/table/blockquote/image/etc. is referenced with

        ~[ ~anchor~ caption ]

    Where caption can contain markup. And where the anchor is signaled
    by using subscript text.

This can be made with a simple `sed` command, but do keep in mind this is a textual change
not an not a semantical one, so it may change too much or too little.

    sed 's/\^\[\(.*\)\:\:/^[ ~\1~ /'
